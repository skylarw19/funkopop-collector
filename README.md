# User Experience:
## User Persona #1:
Although pretending otherwise, David is obsessed with FunkoPops - he has a secret collection of them in his underground vault. He is desperately trying to maintain a cool and aloof persona and can't let his dog see him constantly wander into the vault. David therefore needs a discrete way to track his collection. Luckily, he has stumbled upon the FunkoPop Collector webapp!

## Next Steps:
- Add personal profile page
- ~~Add wishlist page~~
- ~~Allow movement of items from wishlist page to collection page~~
- Add search functionality
- Create categories to sort/filter collection
